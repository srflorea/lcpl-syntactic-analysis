Compilers homework 1: Syntactic Analysis

This archive contains a Makefile file which has rules for build, clean and run.
The rule for run uses a lcpl program file that has to be in a folder "test" and
puts the output(an serialized ast tree) in a file from "bin" folder.
The sources are: the classes for generating the tree that Compilers course team
provide us,  "LCPLClass.java" that uses the classes that are generated for running
and two grammars, one for parsing the input file and generating the AST and one
for parsing the AST and generating the tree program.
The homework is working completely.
