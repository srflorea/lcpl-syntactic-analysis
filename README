Syntactic Analysis for LCPL programming language

LCPL is an academic programming language written by past students at University
Politehnica of Bucharest and is used by students during the Compilers course.

This project contains a Makefile file which has rules for build, clean and run.
The rule for run uses a lcpl input code file that has to be in a folder "test"
and puts the output(an serialized AST[abstract syntax tree] tree) in a file from
"bin" folder.The sources are: the classes for generating the tree that Compilers
course team provide us,  "LCPLClass.java" that uses the classes that are
generated for running and two ANTLR grammars, one for parsing the input file and
generating the AST and one for parsing the AST and generating the tree program.
